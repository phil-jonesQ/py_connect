Keith Galli intemenplation of Connect 4
Modified - Phil Jones January 2021
* Change End of Game mechanic to allow a reset with the SPACE BAR
* Add animate piece drop function - so it simulates the piece dropping down the board
* Add empty board animation - so it simulates all the pieces being emptied
* Implement minimax AI - again, from Keith Galli (see license above)
* Add level selection mechanism (sets the depth for the minimax)
* Add a Player Amount Selection i.e. allow two player mode to work again
